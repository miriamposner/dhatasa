We’ll hold these consultations from 5 to 7 p.m. on Thursday, November 17, in the Denver Convention Center, Level 3, Mineral Hall D.\r\n\r\nWe can think your idea through with you, suggest useful tools and resources, and give you some suggestions about where you might go next.\r\n\r\nWhat is a digital project? Our definition is broad, and we’ll do our best to help you accomplish whatever you’re imagining. Some popular types of projects include maps, data visualizations, text analysis projects, and experiments in scholarly publishing and pedagogy.\r\n\r\nWe think American studies scholars have the potential to undertake transformative digital scholarship, and we’re offering these consultations in the hopes of fostering some of this work.\r\n\r\n***To request a meeting, please [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXKqDoz-sUaXgxRblh6CFFUWhuFPJdwl9FVPki7xj43bH1rA/viewform) by Saturday, October 1.***\r\n\r\n(If you would like to be a consultant on digital projects and are planning to attend ASA 2016 in Denver, please [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNh-gQ9Qd3iLIj2BFL7y-QvXGXXylO_seB0mFxE5zluCi_PQ/viewform)!)\r\n\r\nQuestions?
