We’ll hold these consultations from 6 to 7 p.m. on Saturday, October 10, in the conference hotel.\r\n\r\nWe can think your idea through with you, suggest useful tools and resources, and give you some suggestions about where you might go next.\r\n\r\nWhat is a digital project? Our definition is broad, and we’ll do our best to help you accomplish whatever you’re imagining. Some popular types of projects include maps, data visualizations, text analysis projects, and experiments in scholarly publishing and pedagogy.\r\n\r\nWe think American studies scholars have the potential to undertake transformative scholarship in the digital humanities field, and we’re offering these consultations in the hopes of fostering some of this work.\r\n\r\nTo request a meeting, please give us some information about yourself and your project by Saturday, September 5.\r\n\r\n(If you would like to be a consultant on digital projects and are planning to attend ASA 2015 in Toronto, please register here!)\r\n\r\nQuestions? Please email miriam.posner@gmail.com.",
