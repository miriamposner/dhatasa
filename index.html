<p>At this year’s American Studies Association annual meeting in Toronto, the Digital Humanities Caucus would like to help you get started on a digital project by offering one-hour consultations with experienced digital humanities practitioners. We’ll hold these consultations from 6 to 7 p.m. on Saturday, October 10, in the conference hotel.</p>

<p>We can think your idea through with you, suggest useful tools and resources, and give you some suggestions about where you might go next.</p>

<p>What is a digital project? Our definition is broad, and we’ll do our best to help you accomplish whatever you’re imagining. Some popular types of projects include maps, data visualizations, text analysis projects, and experiments in scholarly publishing and pedagogy.</p>

<p>We think American studies scholars have the potential to undertake transformative scholarship in the digital humanities field, and we’re offering these consultations in the hopes of fostering some of this work.</p>

<p>To request a meeting, please give us some information about yourself and your project by Saturday, September 5.</p>

<p>(If you would like to be a consultant on digital projects and are planning to attend ASA 2015 in Toronto, please register here!)</p>
